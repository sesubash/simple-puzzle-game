simple-puzzle-game
==================

A simple puzzle game that is made with javascript.

This game can be defined as a simple puzzle/brain game, to learn how to play it, go to How to Play or visit http://eminkura.com 

This game is developed by Emin KURA by using Javascript and Raphael JS library. 

I have updated the code to render the game object inside a dom element (DIV).
